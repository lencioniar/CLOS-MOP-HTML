    <H2>Introduction</H2>
    <P>
      The
      <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node260.html#SECTION003200000000000000000">
	CLOS Specification</a> describes the standard Programmer
      Interface for the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).  This
      document extends that specification by defining a metaobject
      protocol for CLOS---that is, a description of CLOS itself as an
      extensible CLOS program.  In this description, the fundamental
      elements of CLOS programs (classes, slot definitions, generic
      functions, methods, specializers and method combinations) are
      represented by first-class objects.  The behavior of CLOS is
      provided by these objects, or, more precisely, by methods
      specialized to the classes of these objects.
      </P>

    <P>
      Because these objects represent pieces of CLOS programs, and
      because their behavior provides the behavior of the CLOS
      language itself, they are considered meta-level objects or
      metaobjects.  The protocol followed by the metaobjects to
      provide the behavior of CLOS is called the CLOS Metaobject
      Protocol (MOP).
