    <H3>Generic function invocation protocol</H3>

    <P>
      Associated with each generic function is its discriminating
      function.  Each time the generic function is called, the
      discriminating function is called to provide the behavior of the
      generic function.  The discriminating function receives the full
      set of arguments received by the generic function.  It must
      lookup and execute the appropriate methods, and return the
      appropriate values.
    </P>

    <P>
      The discriminating function is computed by the highest layer of
      the generic function invocation protocol,
      <a href="compute-discriminating-function.html">
	compute-discriminating-function</a>.
      Whenever a generic function
      metaobject is initialized, reinitialized, or a method is added
      or removed, the discriminating function is recomputed.  The new
      discriminating function is then stored with
      <a href="set-funcallable-instance-function.html">
	set-funcallable-instance-function</a>.
    </P>

    <P>
      Discriminating functions call
      <a href="compute-applicable-methods.html">
	compute-applicable-methods</a>
      and 
      <a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes.html">
	compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</a>
      to compute
      the methods applicable to the generic functions arguments.
      Applicable methods are combined by
      <a href="compute-effective-method.html">
	compute-effective-method</a> to produce an <I>effective
      method</I>.  Provisions are made to allow memoization of the
      method applicability and effective methods computations.  (See
      the description of
      <a href="compute-discriminating-function.html">
	compute-discriminating-function</a> for details.)
    </P>
      
    <P>
      The body of method definitions are processed by
      <a href="make-method-lambda.html">
	make-method-lambda</a>.  The result of this generic function
      is a lambda expression which is processed by either
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_cmp.htm#compile">
	compile</a> or the file compiler to produce a <I>method
      function</I>.  The arguments received by the method function are
      controlled by the
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_call_m.htm#call-method">call-method</a>
      forms appearing in the
      effective methods.  By default, method functions accept two
      arguments: a list of arguments to the generic function, and a
      list of next methods.  The list of next methods corresponds to
      the next methods argument to 
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_call_m.htm#call-method">call-method</a>.  If 
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_call_m.htm#call-method">call-method</a>
      appears with additional arguments, these will be passed to the
      method functions as well; in these cases,
      <a href="make-method-lambda.html">
	make-method-lambda</a>
      must have created the method lambdas to
      expect additional arguments.
    </P>
