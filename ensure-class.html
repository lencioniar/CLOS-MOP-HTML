<A NAME="ensure-class"><I>Function</I>
  <B>ENSURE-CLASS</B>

<P><B>Syntax:</B></P>

<P><B>ensure-class</B> 
<I>name</I> <TT>&key</TT> <TT>&allow-other-keys</TT>
=&gt; <I>class</I></P>

<P><B>Arguments and values:</B></P>

<P><I>name</I> -- A symbol.</P>

<P><I>class</I> -- A class metaobject.</P>

<P><B>Description:</B></P>

<p>
Some of the keyword arguments accepted by this function are actually
processed by
<a href="ensure-class-using-class.html">ensure-class-using-class</a>,
others are processed during initialization of the class metaobject (as
described in the section called
<a href="initialization-of-class-metaobjects.html">
``Initialization of Class Metaobjects''</a>).
</p>

<p>
This function is called to define or redefine a class with the
specified name, and can be called by the user or the implementation.
It is the functional equivalent of
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defclass">
defclass</a>, and is called by the expansion of the
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defclass">
defclass</a> macro.
</p>

<p>
The behavior of this function is actually implemented by the generic
function 
<a href="ensure-class-using-class.html">ensure-class-using-class</a>.
When <B>ensure-class</B> is
called, it immediately calls
<a href="ensure-class-using-class.html">ensure-class-using-class</a>
and returns that result as its own.
