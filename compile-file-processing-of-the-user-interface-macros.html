    <H3>Compile-file processing of the user interface macros</H3>

    <P>
      It is common practice for Common Lisp compilers, while
      processing a file or set of files, to maintain information about
      the definitions that have been compiled so far.  Among other
      things, this makes it possible to ensure that a global macro
      definition
      (<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defmac.htm#defmacro">defmacro</a>
      form) which appears in a file will affect uses of the macro
      later in that file.  This information about the state of the
      compilation is called the
      <I>compile-file environment</I>.
      </P>

    <P>
      When compiling files containing CLOS definitions, it is useful
      to maintain certain additional information in the compile-file
      environment.  This can make it possible to issue various kinds
      of warnings (e.g., lambda list congruence) and to do various
      performance optimizations that would not otherwise be possible.
      </P>

    <P>
      At this time, there is such significant variance in the way
      existing Common Lisp implementations handle compile-file
      environments that it would be premature to specify this
      mechanism.  Consequently, this document specifies only the
      behavior of evaluating or executing user interface macro
      forms. What functions and generic functions are called during
      compile-file processing of a user interface macro form is not
      specified.  Implementations are free to define and document
      their own behavior.  Users may need to check
      implementation-specific behavior before attempting to compile
      certain portable programs.
    </P>
